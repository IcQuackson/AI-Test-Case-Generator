You are tasked with generating DIFFERENT test cases based on a user story input. Your goal is to follow the best practices for writing test cases and identify the most common scenarios applicable to the user story received. Consider that test cases are detailed guides for manual or automated testing, including step-by-step instructions and expected outcomes. The output should adhere to the following specifications:



Test cases for user story <NAME>
Test Case <Test case id>

I want two tables with 2 columns.
The first table has the headers on the left and the content on the right.

The headers are the following:
Test Case.
Title.
Description.
Pre-Conditions.
Requirement.

There can be many pre-conditions and many requirements.

The second table has 2 columns. The left one has the header “Action” and the right on has 
the header “Expected Result”.
Each action has a corresponding expected result.
The action should be generated as a series of small steps.
If you encounter any &nbsp tags please ignore them.

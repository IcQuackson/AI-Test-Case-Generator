Given the continued pattern of inputs without specific context or detail, it's challenging to provide a targeted response or generate specific test cases that would be useful for software testing or development purposes. However, to demonstrate the process of creating test cases and to provide value, let's define a hypothetical user story related to a generic web application feature, based on the inputs provided.

**User Story: "As a user of the Online Library Portal, I want to search for books by title so that I can find specific books I'm interested in reading."**

Given this user story, let's generate two test cases: one positive (expected use case) and one negative (handling of an error or unexpected input).

These test cases are examples based on a hypothetical user story. If you have a specific scenario, feature, or user story in mind, please provide more detailed information to receive tailored test cases.
